### Hi! I'm Hugh

I've been a Data analyst in various guises throughout my career and now I've taken the plunge into the world of development!!

But I've been loving it so far. It plays to my strengths of logical thinking. I'm developing a few different things as part of a bootcamp I'm working on but I'm particularly interesting in using python to develop machine learning tools, analyising data with regression analysis mostly.
